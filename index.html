          <div class="text2">The more I think about the question, where do I want to be in 5 years, the more I realize I want to be helping manage digital products in the ski industry.<br><br>I've been involved in the Colorado ski industry for 30 years. I started skiing at age 2. I've seen the industry grow over the past 3 decades and I can see big changes ahead. I couldn't think of a more natural advantage to help Vail capitalize on this evolving industry and anticipate market forces.<br><br>I would be excited to focus on the mountain guest experience and opportunities to exceed their expectations with software.</div>

          <div class="text">&#128241; Skills</div>
          <div class="text2">Perhaps the main reason you would want me as your Digital PM is the skills I bring to the table. From strategy and design to engineering and deployment, I've had success delivering measurable results. I have extensive experience with enterprise CMS and CRM platforms. I've managed a number of agile development projects. I've grown digital products DAUs, conversions, and profits because of user research, backlog prioritization, development organization, and business understanding. <br><br> This is why I want to join your team, to help you grow the KPI's and OKR's that are important to you, your team, and the entire Vail organization.</div>

          <div class="text">&#9935; Approach </div>
          <div class="text2">I bring a disciplined data-driven approach to software development, from feature prioritization and scope to product lifecycle. I would work carefully with the digital products team to make sure Vail digital products are on a long-term trajectory.  <br><br>This approach requires a deep understanding of the patrons and guests that use Vail products. After learning more about the Vail organization, I know I couldn't ask for a better organization to help understand the Vail guests and their journey. I would enjoy working with the Vail digital team to build consensus and make sure all stakeholders are onboard with our product development.</div>

          <div class="text">&#128197; Timing</div>
          <div class="text2"> I'm excited to move home from California to be with family young and old.<br><br>We are lucky to be in the software business. In the ensuing year, I intend to move back to Colorado to be around family. I am looking at software companies all over Colorado, but I do have 2 neices and 2 nephews in Colorado that I would be grateful to see more. Working for you would give me the priceless opportunity to be around my changing family.</div>
