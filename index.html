          <div class="text2">The more I think about the question, where do I want to be in 5 years, the more I realize I want to be helping manage digital products in the ski industry :)<br><br>I've been involved in the Colorado ski industry for 30 years. I started skiing at age 2. I've seen the industry evolve over the past 3 decades and I can see big changes ahead. I couldn't think of a more natural advantage to help Vail capitalize on this evolving industry and anticipate market forces.<br><br>Even if now isn't the right time for us to work together, I'm excited to start focusing on the mountain guest experience and opportunities for exceeding their expectations with software.</div>

          <div class="text">&#128241; Skills</div>
          <div class="text2">Perhaps the main reason you would want me as your Digital PM is the skills I bring to the table. From strategy and design to engineering and deployment, I've had success delivering measurable results. I have extensive experience with enterprise CMS and CRM platforms. I've managed a number of agile development projects. I've grown digital products DAUs, conversions, and profits because of user research, backlog prioritization, development organization, and business understanding. <br><br> This is why I want to join your team, to help you grow the KPI's and OKR's that are important to you, your team, and the entire ASC organization.</div>

          <div class="text">&#9935; Approach </div>
          <div class="text2">I bring a disciplined data-driven approach to software development, from feature prioritization and scope to product lifecycle. I would work carefully with you to make sure ASC digital products are on a long-term trajectory.  <br><br>This approach requires a deep understanding of the patrons and guests that use ASC products. After meeting you, I know I couldn't ask for a better leader to understand the ASC guests and their journey. I would enjoy working with you to build consensus with our team and make sure all stakeholders are onboard with our product development.</div>

          <div class="text">&#128197; Timing</div>
          <div class="text2"> I'm excited to move home from California to be with family young and old.<br><br>We are lucky to be software managers. Not everyone is fortunate to find a career they love. In the ensuing year, I intend to move back to Colorado to be around family. I am looking at software companies all over Colorado, but I do have 2 nephews in Carbondale that I would be grateful to see more. Working for you would give me the priceless opportunity to be around my changing family.</div>

          <div class="text2">I genuinely respect your decision to explore other candidates, but I can't help to think we would be an incredible team.<br><br>I want to work for you and help you manage your Digital Product portfolio. I'm excited by all of your products and would gladly manage or own the products you want me to. I would be eager to work with you and make your job better.<br><br>If anything with you team changes or you know another department for which I would be a suitable candidate, I'd be happy to provide additional consideration. <br><br>Thank you, <br> thomas.huntsman@gmail.com</div>
